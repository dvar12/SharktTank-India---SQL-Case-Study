# SharkTank SQL Case Study

This project is an end-to-end SQL project that focuses on analyzing the Shark Tank dataset. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and underwent a comprehensive data cleaning process using Python for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. The cleaned data was then loaded into MySQL Workbench for further analysis.

## Project Overview

In this project, I delved into the dynamics of the Shark Tank dataset, which is one of my favorite datasets to work with. The project was challenging and required me to tackle complex logical problems using SQL queries. I thoroughly enjoyed the process and pushed my boundaries to gain a deeper understanding of SQL techniques.

## Dataset Extraction and Cleaning

The dataset was extracted from Kaggle and required extensive cleaning to ensure data integrity and quality. Using Python, I performed data scrubbing and transformation operations to prepare the dataset for analysis. This involved handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and resolving inconsistencies.

## MySQL Workbench and SQL Techniques

The cleaned dataset was loaded into MySQL Workbench, where I utilized various SQL techniques to explore and analyze the data. Some of the techniques I employed include:

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for creating temporary result sets and simplifying complex queries.
- Joins to combine data from multiple tables based on common columns.
- Subqueries to nest queries within other queries for advanced filtering and calculations.
- Stored Procedures to encapsulate SQL code for reuse and modularity.
- `load_infile` to efficiently load large amounts of data into MySQL tables.

## Project Questions

The project aimed to answer eight specific questions using SQL queries. These questions covered a range of topics related to investment patterns, industry trends, and success rates of pitches in Shark Tank. Some of the questions I addressed include:

1. Which industry received the highest funding in Shark Tank?
2. What is the ratio of female to male pitchers in each industry?
3. How many pitches were made each season? How many received offers? How many were successfully converted?
4. Which season had the highest average monthly sales? Which industries performed the best during that season?
5. Which industries consistently raised funds over multiple seasons? How did the number of pitches, offers, and conversions vary within each industry?
6. How long will it take for investors to recoup their principal investment based on the total deal and equity given to a startup?
7. Which shark tends to invest the most money on average in each deal?
8. Which shark has the most diversified investment portfolio across various industries?

## Conclusion

This project provided me with an opportunity to work on a complex SQL case study using the Shark Tank dataset. By leveraging SQL techniques and tools like MySQL Workbench, I gained valuable insights into investment patterns, industry trends, and the success rates of pitches on the show.
